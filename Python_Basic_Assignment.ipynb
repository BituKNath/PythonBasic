        "# Python Basic Assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Python is a high-level programming language. It’s popular because it’s easy to learn yet powerful enough for complex projects like data analysis and artificial intelligence. Plus, its free libraries and active community make solving problems faster.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "  - In Python, an interpreter is a program that executes code line by line. It reads each instruction, checks for errors, converts it to bytecode, and runs it.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the language. They are part of Python’s syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        " - No, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Mutability in Python determines if an object can be changed after creation. Mutable objects (like lists) allow modifications, while immutable ones (like strings) do not. This affects memory usage, function behavior, and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Lists are mutable to support dynamic operations like adding or removing items, while tuples are immutable to ensure data integrity and performance. For example, a list of usernames can be updated, but a tuple storing (latitude, longitude) should remain unchanged to avoid errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - \"==\" checks if two objects have the same value (e.g., [1,2] == [1,2] is True), while \"is\" checks if they are the exact same object in memory (e.g., a = [1,2]; b = a; a is b is True).\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Logical operators (and, or, not) are fundamental to Python programming, enabling developers to construct sophisticated conditional logic.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, type casting (or type conversion) is how you change a value from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Implicit Type Casting happens automatically. Python handles this conversion behind the scenes, usually when performing operations between compatible data types (like adding an integer and a float). It's designed to prevent data loss and ensure operations run smoothly, automatically promoting the \"lower\" type to the \"higher\" type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Explicit Type Casting requires you to manually convert a type using built-in functions such as int(), float(), or str(). You directly control the conversion, which is necessary when Python can't automatically convert types, or when you specifically want to change a value's type. This can sometimes lead to data loss (e.g., converting a float to an integer truncates the decimal).\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of execution in a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The elif statement in Python, which stands for \"else if,\" functions as a way to create a series of conditional checks after an initial if statement. When our program encounters an if-elif-else structure, it first evaluates the condition of the if statement. If that condition is true, its block of code runs, and the entire conditional block is skipped. However, if the if condition is false, Python moves on to the first elif statement. It then checks the condition associated with that elif. If this elif's condition is true, its code block executes, and the program exits the whole conditional structure. If that elif's condition is also false, Python proceeds to the next elif in the sequence, continuing this process until it finds a condition that evaluates to true. The key is that only the code block for the first true condition encountered in the entire if-elif-else chain will be executed, and any subsequent elif or the else (if present) will be ignored. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, then the optional else block serves as a default action and will be executed. This sequential evaluation allows us to handle multiple distinct possibilities in a structured and efficient manner.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        " - \"for\" loop is used for iterating over sequences or a known number of times, but \"while\" loop is used for repeating code as long as a condition remains true, for an unknown number of iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        " - A while loop is more suitable when the number of repetitions needed is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition being met. A prime example is validating user input: imagine we need to ask a user to enter a password and keep prompting them until the entered password meets specific criteria (e.g., minimum length, containing special characters). We have no idea how many attempts the user might need to get it right. A for loop, designed for iterating a fixed number of times or over a predefined sequence, would be inappropriate here. A while loop, however, excels because it can simply continue to loop as long as the input condition (e.g., password invalid) remains true, stopping only once the valid input is provided.\n",
